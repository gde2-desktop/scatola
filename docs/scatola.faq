1.  What is Scatola ?

  Scatola is an open-source file manager and graphical shell being
  developed by Eazel, Inc. and others. It is part of the GDE2 project, and its
  source code can be found in the GDE2 CVS repository. Scatola is still in
  the early stages of development. It will become an integral part of the
  GDE2 desktop environment when it is finished.
